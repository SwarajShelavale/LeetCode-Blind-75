# LeetCode Problem 56: [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

## Problem Description
Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

## Solution Approach
- We sort the intervals based on the start times.
- We iterate through the sorted intervals and merge overlapping intervals.
- We maintain a list `mergedIntervals` to store the merged intervals.
- For each interval, if it does not overlap with the previous merged interval, we add it to the list.
- If it overlaps, we update the end time of the previous merged interval.
- Finally, we convert the list to a 2D array and return it.

## Java Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        List<int[]> mergedIntervals = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            int size = mergedIntervals.size();
            if (mergedIntervals.isEmpty() || mergedIntervals.get(size - 1)[1] < intervals[i][0])
                mergedIntervals.add(intervals[i]);
            else
                mergedIntervals.get(size - 1)[1] = Math.max(mergedIntervals.get(size - 1)[1], intervals[i][1]);
        }
        return mergedIntervals.toArray(new int[mergedIntervals.size()][2]);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals. Sorting the intervals takes O(n log n) time, and merging them takes linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the merged intervals.

## Code Explanation
1. We sort the intervals based on the start times using `Arrays.sort()` and a custom comparator.
2. We iterate through the sorted intervals and merge overlapping intervals:
   - If the `mergedIntervals` list is empty or the end time of the previous merged interval is less than the start time of the current interval, we add the current interval to the list.
   - Otherwise, we update the end time of the previous merged interval if needed.
3. Finally, we convert the list of merged intervals to a 2D array and return it.
