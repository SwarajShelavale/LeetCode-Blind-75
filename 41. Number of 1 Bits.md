# LeetCode Problem 191: [Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

## Problem Description

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

## Solution Approach

We iterate through each bit of the given integer and count the number of set bits.

## Java Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
       int count=0;
       for(int i=0;i<32;i++)
       {
           count+=(n&1);
           n=n>>1;
       }
       return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1). We iterate through 32 bits of the integer, which is constant.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). Constant space is used.

## Code Explanation

- We initialize an integer `count` to store the count of set bits (1s).
- We iterate through each bit of the given integer `n`.
- If the least significant bit is set (1), we increment the count.
- We right shift the integer `n` by one bit.
- Finally, we return the count of set bits.
