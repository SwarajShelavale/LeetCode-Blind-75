# LeetCode Problem 76: [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

## Problem Description
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t`. If there is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return an empty string `""`.

## Solution Approach
- We use a sliding window approach to find the minimum window substring.
- We maintain two maps: one to store the frequency of characters in the target string `t`, and another to store the frequency of characters in the current window.
- We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to maintain the window boundaries.
- We expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and contract the window by moving the `left` pointer.
- At each step, we update the minimum length and record the start and end indices of the minimum window substring.

## Java Solution Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
        Map<Character, Integer> targetMap = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Character, Integer> windowMap = new HashMap<>();
        int targetLength = t.length();
        int sLength = s.length();

        // Constructing the targetMap to count characters in string t
        for (int i = 0; i < targetLength; i++) {
            char ch = t.charAt(i);
            targetMap.put(ch, targetMap.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }

        int requiredChars = targetMap.size();
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int currentChars = 0;
        int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int start = 0, end = 0;

        while (right < sLength) {
            // Expand the window by adding the right character
            char rightChar = s.charAt(right);
            windowMap.put(rightChar, windowMap.getOrDefault(rightChar, 0) + 1);

            // Check if the added character contributes to the required characters
            if (targetMap.containsKey(rightChar) && windowMap.get(rightChar).equals(targetMap.get(rightChar))) {
                currentChars++;
            }

            // Contract the window
            while (currentChars == requiredChars) {
                // Update the minimum length and record the start and end indices
                if (right - left + 1 < minLength) {
                    minLength = right - left + 1;
                    start = left;
                    end = right;
                }

                // Move the left pointer to contract the window
                char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
                windowMap.put(leftChar, windowMap.get(leftChar) - 1);

                // Check if the removed character affects the required characters
                if (targetMap.containsKey(leftChar) && windowMap.get(leftChar) < targetMap.get(leftChar)) {
                    currentChars--;
                }

                left++; // Move the left pointer to the right
            }

            right++; // Move the right pointer to the right
        }

        return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? "" : s.substring(start, end + 1);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(S + T), where S is the length of string `s` and T is the length of string `t`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(S + T), where S is the length of string `s` and T is the length of string `t`.

## Code Explanation
1. We construct a map `targetMap` to count the frequency of characters in the target string `t`.
2. We use a sliding window approach with two pointers `left` and `right` to find the minimum window substring.
3. As we expand the window, we update the windowMap to count the frequency of characters in the current window.
4. We contract the window when all characters in the target string are present in the window.
5. At each step, we update the minimum length and record the start and end indices of the minimum window substring.

Detailed Code Explanation:
- We first create two maps, `targetMap` and `windowMap`, to store the character frequencies of the target string `t` and the current window, respectively.
- We iterate through the characters of string `t` and populate `targetMap` with the character frequencies.
- We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define the window boundaries. Initially, both pointers are set to the beginning of the string `s`.
- We iterate through the string `s` using the `right` pointer and expand the window by adding characters to `windowMap`.
- As we expand the window, we check if the added character contributes to the required characters in `t`. If it does, we increment the `currentChars` count.
- When the window contains all required characters, we start contracting the window by moving the `left` pointer.
- We update the minimum length and record the start and end indices of the minimum window substring whenever we find a valid window.
- Finally, we return the minimum window substring or an empty string if no valid window is found.
