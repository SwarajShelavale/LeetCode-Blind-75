# LeetCode Problem: 213. [House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)

## Problem Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Solution Approach

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. Since the houses are arranged in a circle, we need to consider two cases: robbing the first house and not robbing the first house. We use two dynamic programming arrays to track the maximum amount of money we can rob in each case.

## Java Solution

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 0)
            return 0;
        if (n == 1)
            return nums[0];
        if (n == 2)
            return Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        
        // Case 1
        int[] dp1 = new int[n + 1];
        dp1[0] = nums[0];
        dp1[1] = Math.max(nums[1], nums[0]);
        for (int i = 2; i < n - 1; i++) {
            dp1[i] = Math.max(dp1[i - 1], dp1[i - 2] + nums[i]);
        }
        
        // Case 2
        int[] dp2 = new int[n + 1];
        dp2[0] = 0;
        dp2[1] = nums[1];
        dp2[2] = Math.max(nums[2], nums[1]);
        for (int i = 3; i < n; i++) {
            dp2[i] = Math.max(dp2[i - 1], dp2[i - 2] + nums[i]);
        }
        
        // Final answer
        return Math.max(dp1[n - 2], dp2[n - 1]);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of houses.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of houses.

## Code Explanation

- We consider two cases: robbing the first house and not robbing the first house.
- We use two dynamic programming arrays to track the maximum amount of money we can rob in each case.
- We iterate through the array and calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed in each case.
- Finally, we return the maximum amount of money between the two cases.
