# LeetCode Problem 11: [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

## Problem Description
   Given `n` non-negative integers `height[i]` where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, height[i])`, `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i` are at `(i, height[i])` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Notice**: You may not slant the container.

## Solution Approach
- We use a two-pointer approach to find the maximum area between two lines.
- Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the array respectively.
- Calculate the area between the lines using the formula `min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)`.
- Update the maximum area if the calculated area is greater than the current maximum.
- Move the pointer with the smaller height inward, as moving the pointer with the larger height cannot increase the area.

## Java Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int area = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            int length = right - left;
            int width = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            area = Math.max(area, length * width);

            if (height[left] < height[right])
                left++;
            else
                right--;
        }

        return area;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the height array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of space.

## Code Explanation
- Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the array.
- Move the pointers towards each other to find the maximum area between two lines.
- Calculate the area using the formula and update the maximum area accordingly.
- Continue this process until the two pointers meet.
