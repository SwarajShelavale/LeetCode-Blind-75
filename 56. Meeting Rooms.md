# LeetCode Problem 252: [Meeting Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of meeting time intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, determine if a person could attend all meetings.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we can sort the intervals based on the start time. Then, we iterate through the sorted intervals and check if there is any overlap between adjacent intervals.

## Java Solution

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public boolean canAttendMeetings(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N), where N is the number of intervals. We sort the intervals based on the start time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), no extra space is used other than the input array.

## Code Explanation

- We sort the intervals based on the start time using a custom comparator.
- Then, we iterate through the sorted intervals and check if there is any overlap between adjacent intervals by comparing the start time of the current interval with the end time of the previous interval.
