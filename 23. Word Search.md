# LeetCode Problem 79: [Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)

## Problem Description
Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` if `word` exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

## Solution Approach
- We perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from each cell in the grid.
- At each cell, we explore the neighboring cells to see if they form the given word.
- We mark visited cells to avoid revisiting them during the DFS traversal.

## Java Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    char matrix[][];
    char letters[];
    boolean visited[][];
    
    public boolean exist(char[][] board, String word) {
        letters = word.toCharArray();
        matrix = board;
        int n = matrix.length, m = matrix[0].length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == letters[0]) {
                    visited = new boolean[n][m];
                    if (dfs(i, j, 0, visited))
                        return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    boolean dfs(int i, int j, int index, boolean visited[][]) {
        if (index >= letters.length)
            return true;
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= matrix.length || j >= matrix[0].length || visited[i][j])
            return false;
        if (matrix[i][j] != letters[index])
            return false;

        visited[i][j] = true;
        boolean bottom = dfs(i + 1, j, index + 1, visited);
        boolean right = dfs(i, j + 1, index + 1, visited);
        boolean top = dfs(i - 1, j, index + 1, visited);
        boolean left = dfs(i, j - 1, index + 1, visited);
        visited[i][j] = false;

        return top || right || bottom || left;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * M * 3^L), where N and M are the dimensions of the grid, and L is the length of the word. We explore up to 3 directions (excluding the cell we came from) for each cell in the grid, and there are N * M starting cells.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N * M), for the boolean array to mark visited cells.

## Code Explanation
1. We iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. If the current cell contains the first character of the word, we initiate a Depth-First Search (DFS) from that cell.
3. During the DFS traversal, we explore neighboring cells in all four directions (up, down, left, right) to find the characters of the word.
4. We mark visited cells to avoid revisiting them during the DFS traversal.
5. If we find the complete word while exploring the neighboring cells, we return true. Otherwise, we return false.
