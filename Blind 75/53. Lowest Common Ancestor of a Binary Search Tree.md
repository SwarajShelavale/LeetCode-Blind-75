# LeetCode Problem 235: [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)

## Problem Description

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

## Solution Approach

To find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a BST, we start from the root node and traverse down the tree. At each step, we compare the values of the current node with the values of the two given nodes, `p` and `q`. Based on the values, we traverse left or right until we find the LCA.

## Java Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root == null)
            return null;
        if(root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val)
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        if(root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val)
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        return root;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the binary search tree. In the worst case, we traverse from the root node to the deepest leaf node.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if the recursive call stack is not considered, otherwise O(H) for the recursive call stack.

## Code Explanation

- We start from the root node and traverse down the tree.
- At each step, we compare the values of the current node with the values of the two given nodes, `p` and `q`.
- Based on the values, we traverse left or right until we find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of `p` and `q`.
- We return the LCA node found.
