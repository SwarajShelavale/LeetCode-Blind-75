# LeetCode Problem 62: [Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

## Problem Description
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid. The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

## Solution Approach
- We use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
- We create a 2D array `dp` to store the number of unique paths for each cell.
- We iterate through each cell in the grid and calculate the number of unique paths based on the number of paths from the cells above and to the left.

## Java Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];

        // Fill the first row and first column with 1
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = 1;
        }

        // Calculate unique paths for each cell
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }

        // Return the number of unique paths for the bottom-right cell
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), for the 2D array `dp`.

## Code Explanation
1. We create a 2D array `dp` to store the number of unique paths for each cell.
2. We fill the first row and first column with 1, as there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row or column.
3. We iterate through each cell in the grid (except the first row and first column) and calculate the number of unique paths based on the number of paths from the cells above and to the left.
4. Finally, we return the number of unique paths for the bottom-right cell.
