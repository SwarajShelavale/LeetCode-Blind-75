# LeetCode Problem 62: [Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/)

## Problem Description

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

## Solution Approach

The problem can be solved using a preorder traversal for serialization and deserialization. We traverse the tree in a preorder manner and append each node's value to the string, marking null nodes with a special character. For deserialization, we split the string by the delimiter and use a queue to reconstruct the binary tree.

## Java Solution

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Deque;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class Codec {
    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    public String serialize(TreeNode root) {
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        BuildString(root, res);
        return res.toString();
    }

    void BuildString(TreeNode root, StringBuilder res) {
        if (root == null) {
            res.append("X").append(",");
        } else {
            res.append(root.val).append(",");
            BuildString(root.left, res);
            BuildString(root.right, res);
        }
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        Deque<String> nodes = new LinkedList<>();
        nodes.addAll(Arrays.asList(data.split(",")));

        return BuildTree(nodes);
    }

    TreeNode BuildTree(Deque<String> nodes) {
        String val = nodes.remove();
        if (val.equals("X"))
            return null;

        TreeNode node = new TreeNode(Integer.valueOf(val));
        node.left = BuildTree(nodes);
        node.right = BuildTree(nodes);

        return node;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for both serialization and deserialization is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

The space complexity for both serialization and deserialization is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

## Code Explanation

- The `serialize` method performs a preorder traversal of the binary tree and constructs a string representation of the tree.
- The `deserialize` method reconstructs the binary tree from the string by using a queue and performing a preorder traversal.

To use this Codec class, you can instantiate an object and call the `serialize` method to serialize a binary tree, and then call the `deserialize` method to deserialize the string back into a binary tree. Make sure to replace `root` with the root of the binary tree you want to serialize or deserialize.
