# LeetCode Problem 371: [Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)

## Problem Description

Calculate the sum of two integers `a` and `b`, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

## Solution Approach

We use bitwise manipulation to calculate the sum of two integers without using the `+` and `-` operators.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int carry = a & b; 
            a = a ^ b; 
            b = carry << 1;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1). The time complexity is constant as the number of iterations in the while loop is limited by the number of bits in the input integers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The space complexity is constant as we are not using any extra space that grows with the input size.

## Code Explanation

- We use bitwise operators to simulate addition without using the `+` and `-` operators.
- Inside the while loop, we calculate the carry using the bitwise AND (`&`) operator and set `b` to the carry shifted one position to the left.
- We update `a` by performing the bitwise XOR (`^`) operation between `a` and `b`.
- We continue this process until `b` becomes zero, which indicates that there is no carry left.
- Finally, we return the value of `a`, which represents the sum of the two integers.
