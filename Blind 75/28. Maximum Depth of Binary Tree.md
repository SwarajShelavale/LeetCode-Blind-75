# LeetCode Problem 104: [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

## Problem Description
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth. A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Solution Approach
- We recursively calculate the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees.
- The maximum depth of the binary tree is the maximum of the depths of the left and right subtrees plus 1.

## Java Solution Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {    
        if(root == null)
            return 0;    
        return 1 + Math.max(maxDepth(root.left), maxDepth(root.right));
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree, representing the recursion stack space.

## Code Explanation
1. The `maxDepth` function takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns its maximum depth.
2. If the root is null, we return 0, indicating that the tree has no depth.
3. Otherwise, we recursively calculate the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees using the `maxDepth` function.
4. We take the maximum of the depths of the left and right subtrees and add 1 to it, representing the depth of the current node.
5. Finally, we return the maximum depth of the binary tree.
