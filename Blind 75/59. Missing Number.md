# LeetCode Problem 268: [Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` containing n distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.


## Solution Approach

To find the missing number, we can utilize the XOR operation. We iterate through the array and XOR each element with its index and the index range [0, n]. The missing number will be revealed through the XOR operation.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
            ans = ans ^ nums[i] ^ (i + 1);
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), no extra space is used.

## Code Explanation

- We initialize a variable `ans` to 0.
- We iterate through the array `nums` and perform XOR (^) operation between `ans`, each element in `nums`, and the index plus 1.
- After the iteration, `ans` will hold the missing number, which we return.
