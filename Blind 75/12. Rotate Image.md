# LeetCode Problem 48: [Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)

## Problem Description
You are given an `n x n` 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

## Solution Approach
- We perform the rotation in two steps: transpose and reverse.
- First, we transpose the matrix by swapping elements across the diagonal.
- Then, we reverse the elements in each row, effectively rotating the matrix by 90 degrees.

## Java Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        // Transpose of Matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].length; j++) {
                if (i < j) {
                    int temp = matrix[j][i];
                    matrix[j][i] = matrix[i][j];
                    matrix[i][j] = temp;
                }
            }
        }

        // Reverse the Column values
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
            int j = 0, k = matrix[0].length - 1;
            while (j < k) {
                int temp = matrix[i][j];
                matrix[i][j] = matrix[i][k];
                matrix[i][k] = temp;
                j++;
                k--;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of rows or columns in the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we perform the rotation in-place without using any additional space.

## Code Explanation
1. We iterate through the upper triangular part of the matrix (above the diagonal) and swap the elements across the diagonal. This operation effectively transposes the matrix.
2. After transposing, we reverse the elements in each row by iterating over each row and swapping elements from both ends of the row.
3. The combined effect of transposing and reversing effectively rotates the image by 90 degrees clockwise.
