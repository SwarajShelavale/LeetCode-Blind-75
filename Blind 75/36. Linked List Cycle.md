# LeetCode Problem 141: [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

## Problem Description

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

## Solution Approach

We use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to detect cycles in the linked list. We have two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, initially pointing to the head of the linked list. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, eventually, the `fast` pointer will meet the `slow` pointer.

## Java Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
       ListNode fast = head, slow = head;

       while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
           slow = slow.next;
           fast = fast.next.next;
           if (slow == fast)
               return true;
       }
       return false;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. We iterate through the linked list once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), constant space is used.

## Code Explanation

1. We define a function `hasCycle` that checks if the linked list has a cycle.
2. We use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, initially pointing to the head of the linked list.
3. In each iteration, `slow` moves one step forward, while `fast` moves two steps forward.
4. If there is a cycle, eventually, the `fast` pointer will meet the `slow` pointer, and we return true.
5. If there is no cycle, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the linked list, and we return false.
