# LeetCode Problem 417: [Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/)

## Problem Description

Given an `m x n` matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of each unit cell in a continent, the "Pacific ocean" touches the left and top edges of the matrix, and the "Atlantic ocean" touches the right and bottom edges.

Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) from a cell to another one with height equal or lower.

Find the list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

## Solution Approach

We perform depth-first search (DFS) from the cells on the borders of the matrix, marking cells that can reach the Pacific and Atlantic oceans separately. Then, we find the cells that can reach both oceans and return their coordinates.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> pacificAtlantic(int[][] heights) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = heights.length, m = heights[0].length;
        boolean[][] pacificVisited = new boolean[n][m];
        boolean[][] atlanticVisited = new boolean[n][m];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dfs(i, 0, heights, pacificVisited, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
            dfs(i, m - 1, heights, atlanticVisited, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
        }

        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            dfs(0, j, heights, pacificVisited, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
            dfs(n - 1, j, heights, atlanticVisited, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (pacificVisited[i][j] && atlanticVisited[i][j]) {
                    ArrayList<Integer> cell = new ArrayList<>();
                    cell.add(i);
                    cell.add(j);
                    result.add(cell);
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    void dfs(int row, int col, int[][] heights, boolean[][] visited, int prevHeight) {
        if (row < 0 || col < 0 || row == heights.length || col == heights[0].length || visited[row][col] || heights[row][col] < prevHeight)
            return;
        
        visited[row][col] = true;

        dfs(row - 1, col, heights, visited, heights[row][col]);
        dfs(row + 1, col, heights, visited, heights[row][col]);
        dfs(row, col - 1, heights, visited, heights[row][col]);
        dfs(row, col + 1, heights, visited, heights[row][col]);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the matrix. We traverse the entire matrix once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the matrix. We use boolean arrays to mark visited cells.

## Code Explanation

- We perform depth-first search (DFS) from the cells on the borders of the matrix, marking cells that can reach the Pacific and Atlantic oceans separately.
- Then, we find the cells that can reach both oceans and return their coordinates.
