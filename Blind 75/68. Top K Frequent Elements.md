# LeetCode Problem 347: [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

## Solution Approach

We use a HashMap to count the frequency of each number in the array. Then, we use a PriorityQueue to store elements based on their frequency. Finally, we extract the top k frequent elements from the PriorityQueue.

## Java Solution

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] topKFrequent(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Create a HashMap to store the frequency of each number
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Count the frequency of each number
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Create a PriorityQueue to store elements based on their frequency
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[1], a[1]));

        // Add elements along with their frequency to the PriorityQueue
        for (int key : frequencyMap.keySet()) {
            pq.add(new int[]{key, frequencyMap.get(key)});
        }
        
        // Extract top k frequent elements from the PriorityQueue
        int[] result = new int[k];
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int[] element = pq.poll();
            result[i] = element[0];
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log k), where n is the length of the input array `nums` and k is the input parameter. Building the frequency map takes O(n) time, and extracting the top k frequent elements from the PriorityQueue takes O(k log k) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. We use a HashMap to store the frequency of each number and a PriorityQueue to store elements based on their frequency.

## Code Explanation

- We count the frequency of each number in the array using a HashMap.
- We store elements along with their frequency in a PriorityQueue, ordering them by frequency in descending order.
- We extract the top k frequent elements from the PriorityQueue and return them.
