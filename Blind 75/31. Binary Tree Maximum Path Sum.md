# LeetCode Problem 124: [Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)

## Problem Description
Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum. For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

## Solution Approach
- We recursively traverse the binary tree in a depth-first manner.
- At each node, we calculate the maximum path sum that passes through that node and update the global maximum path sum accordingly.
- We return the maximum path sum found after traversing the entire tree.

## Java Solution Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    int maxPath = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;
      
        findMaxPathSum(root);
        return maxPath;
    }

    int findMaxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            maxPath = Math.max(maxPath, root.val);
            return root.val;
        }
        
        int leftPathSum = 0;
        int rightPathSum = 0;
        if (root.left != null)
            leftPathSum = Math.max(0, findMaxPathSum(root.left));
        if (root.right != null)
            rightPathSum = Math.max(0, findMaxPathSum(root.right));

        maxPath = Math.max(maxPath, root.val + leftPathSum + rightPathSum);
        return root.val + Math.max(leftPathSum, rightPathSum);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. The space is used for the recursive call stack.

## Code Explanation
1. We define a recursive function `findMaxPathSum` that calculates the maximum path sum passing through a given node.
2. At each node, we calculate the maximum path sum that includes the node itself and return it to the parent node.
3. We update the global maximum path sum (`maxPath`) whenever we encounter a new maximum during the traversal.
4. We handle the base case when a node has no left or right child (i.e., it is a leaf node).
5. We traverse the binary tree in a depth-first manner, starting from the root.
6. Finally, we return the maximum path sum found after traversing the entire tree.
