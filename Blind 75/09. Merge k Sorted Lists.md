# LeetCode Problem 23: [Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)

## Problem Description
Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity without examples and constraints.

## Solution Approach
- We merge the k sorted linked lists by iterating through each list and merging them two at a time.
- We repeatedly merge two lists until we have merged all the lists into one sorted list.

## Java Solution Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {
        int n = lists.length;
        ListNode newHead = null;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            newHead = mergeTwoLists(newHead, lists[i]);
        
        return newHead;
    }

    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        if (l1 == null)
            return l2;
        else if (l2 == null)
            return l1;
        
        ListNode head = null, tail = null, cur1 = l1, cur2 = l2;
        if (cur1.val < cur2.val) {
            head = cur1;
            tail = cur1;
            cur1 = cur1.next;
        } else {
            head = cur2;
            tail = cur2;
            cur2 = cur2.next;
        }

        while (cur1 != null && cur2 != null) {
            if (cur1.val < cur2.val) {
                tail.next = cur1;
                tail = tail.next;
                cur1 = cur1.next;
            } else {
                tail.next = cur2;
                tail = tail.next;
                cur2 = cur2.next;
            }
        }

        if (cur1 == null)
            tail.next = cur2;
        else
            tail.next = cur1;

        return head;
    }
}
```

## Code Explanation
1. We define a class `Solution` that contains the method `mergeKLists` to merge k sorted lists.
2. In the `mergeKLists` method, we iterate through each list and merge them two at a time using the `mergeTwoLists` method.
3. The `mergeTwoLists` method merges two sorted linked lists and returns the merged list.
4. We maintain pointers `head` and `tail` to keep track of the merged list while iterating through the two lists.
5. We compare the values of the current nodes in the two lists and append the smaller node to the merged list.
6. Finally, we return the merged list.

This approach ensures that we merge all k sorted lists into one sorted list.
