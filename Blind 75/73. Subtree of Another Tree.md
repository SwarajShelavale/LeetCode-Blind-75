# LeetCode Problem 572: [Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/)

## Problem Description

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return true if `subRoot` is a subtree of `root`, otherwise return false. A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the main tree (`root`) and at each node, check if the subtree rooted at that node is identical to the given `subRoot` tree. We continue this process recursively until we find a match or exhaust all nodes in the main tree.

## Java Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    boolean isSubtreeFound = false;

    public boolean isSubtree(TreeNode root, TreeNode subRoot) {
        if (root == null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (isSameTree(root, subRoot)) {
            return true;
        }

        return isSubtree(root.left, subRoot) || isSubtree(root.right, subRoot);
    }

    boolean isSameTree(TreeNode nodeA, TreeNode nodeB) {
        if (nodeA == null && nodeB == null) {
            return true;
        }

        if (nodeA == null || nodeB == null) {
            return false;
        }

        return nodeA.val == nodeB.val && isSameTree(nodeA.left, nodeB.left) && isSameTree(nodeA.right, nodeB.right);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n) where m is the number of nodes in the main tree and n is the number of nodes in the subtree. In the worst case, we traverse the main tree and at each node, we traverse the subtree to check for equality.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) where h is the height of the main tree. The space complexity is determined by the recursion stack during the depth-first search.

## Code Explanation

- We perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the main tree (`root`) and at each node, check if the subtree rooted at that node is identical to the given `subRoot` tree.
- We continue this process recursively until we find a match or exhaust all nodes in the main tree.
