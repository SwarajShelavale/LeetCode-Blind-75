# LeetCode Problem 217: [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

## Solution Approach

We can solve this problem using a HashSet. We iterate through the array and add each element to the HashSet. If we encounter an element that is already present in the HashSet, it means the array contains a duplicate, and we return true. Otherwise, we return false.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) {
       Set<Integer> s = new HashSet<Integer>();
       int n = nums.length;
       for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            s.add(nums[i]);

        return s.size() != n;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array.

## Code Explanation

- We use a HashSet to store unique elements from the array.
- We iterate through the array and add each element to the HashSet.
- If the size of the HashSet is not equal to the number of elements in the array, it means there are duplicate elements, and we return true.
- Otherwise, we return false.
