# LeetCode Problem 211: [Design Add and Search Words Data Structure](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-add-and-search-words-data-structure/)

## Problem Description

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

- `void addWord(word)`: Adds a word into the data structure.
- `bool search(word)`: Returns true if the word is in the data structure. A word could contain the dot character '.' to represent any one letter.

## Solution Approach

We implement a Trie data structure where each node contains an array of child nodes representing each character in the alphabet. We define methods to add a word into the trie and search for a word in the trie, where the word may contain the dot character '.' to represent any one letter.

## Java Solution

```java
class WordDictionary {
    private WordDictionary[] children;
    boolean isEndOfWord;

    public WordDictionary() {
        children = new WordDictionary[26];
        isEndOfWord = false;
    }
    
    public void addWord(String word) {
        WordDictionary curr = this;
        for(char c: word.toCharArray()){
            if(curr.children[c - 'a'] == null)
                curr.children[c - 'a'] = new WordDictionary();
            curr = curr.children[c - 'a'];
        }
        curr.isEndOfWord = true;
    }
    
    public boolean search(String word) {
        WordDictionary curr = this;
        for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); ++i){
            char c = word.charAt(i);
            if(c == '.'){
                for(WordDictionary ch: curr.children)
                    if(ch != null && ch.search(word.substring(i+1))) return true;
                return false;
            }
            if(curr.children[c - 'a'] == null) return false;
            curr = curr.children[c - 'a'];
        }
        return curr != null && curr.isEndOfWord;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
    - `addWord`: O(n), where n is the length of the word being added.
    - `search`: O(n), where n is the length of the word being searched.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m*n), where m is the number of words and n is the average length of the words.

## Code Explanation

- We define a WordDictionary class with methods to add a word and search for a word.
- Each node in the trie contains an array of child nodes representing each character in the alphabet.
- We recursively add each character of the word into the trie starting from the root node.
- We recursively search for each character of the word in the trie starting from the root node, allowing '.' to represent any one letter.
