# LeetCode Problem 49: [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

## Problem Description
Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Solution Approach
- We use a HashMap to group anagrams.
- For each string in the array, we sort its characters and use the sorted string as a key in the HashMap.
- We add the original string to the list corresponding to its sorted key.
- Finally, we return the values of the HashMap, which are the grouped anagrams.

## Java Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
       HashMap<String, List<String>> mp = new HashMap<>();
       int n = strs.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String temp = strs[i];
            char[] arr = temp.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(arr);
            String sorted = new String(arr);

            if (!mp.containsKey(sorted)) {
                mp.put(sorted, new ArrayList<>());
                mp.get(sorted).add(temp);
            } else {
                mp.get(sorted).add(temp);
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(mp.values());
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * K * log K), where N is the number of strings in the array and K is the maximum length of a string.
  - We iterate through the array of strings, which takes O(N) time.
  - Sorting each string takes O(K * log K) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N * K), where N is the number of strings in the array and K is the maximum length of a string.
  - We use extra space to store the HashMap, which can hold N * K key-value pairs.

## Code Explanation
1. We iterate through each string in the array `strs`.
2. For each string, we sort its characters and use the sorted string as a key in the HashMap `mp`.
3. If the sorted string is not already present in the HashMap, we create a new list and add the original string to it.
4. If the sorted string is already present, we retrieve the corresponding list from the HashMap and add the original string to it.
5. Finally, we return the values of the HashMap, which contain the grouped anagrams.
