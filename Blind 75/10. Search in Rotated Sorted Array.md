# LeetCode Problem 33: [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

## Problem Description
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order, which is rotated at some pivot point unknown beforehand, and a `target` value to search. If the target is found in the array, return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

## Solution Approach
- We perform binary search on the rotated sorted array to find the target element.
- We update the boundaries of the search based on whether the mid element is in the left or right half of the rotated array.

## Java Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        // Get the length of the array
        int n = nums.length;
        // Initialize pointers for binary search
        int low = 0, high = n - 1;

        // Binary search loop
        while (low <= high) {
            // Calculate the middle index
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            // If target found at mid index, return mid
            if (nums[mid] == target)
                return mid;
            // If left half is sorted
            else if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) {
                // If target is in the right half or outside the sorted left half
                if (target > nums[mid] || target < nums[low])
                    low = mid + 1;  // Move the low pointer to the right half
                else
                    high = mid - 1; // Move the high pointer to the left half
            } 
            // If right half is sorted
            else {
                // If target is in the left half or outside the sorted right half
                if (target < nums[mid] || target > nums[high])
                    high = mid - 1; // Move the high pointer to the left half
                else
                    low = mid + 1;  // Move the low pointer to the right half
            }
        }
        return -1; // Target not found
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log N), where N is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), constant extra space is used.

## Code Explanation
1. We initialize pointers `low` and `high` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. We use a binary search loop to iterate until `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
3. In each iteration, we calculate the `mid` index using the formula `low + (high - low) / 2`.
4. We check if the `target` is found at the `mid` index. If yes, we return `mid`.
5. If the left half is sorted (`nums[low] <= nums[mid]`), we determine if the `target` is in the right half or outside the sorted left half. We adjust the `low` or `high` pointers accordingly.
6. If the right half is sorted, we determine if the `target` is in the left half or outside the sorted right half. We adjust the `low` or `high` pointers accordingly.
7. If the `target` is not found in the array, we return `-1`.
