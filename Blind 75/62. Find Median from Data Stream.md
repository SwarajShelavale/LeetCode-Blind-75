# LeetCode Problem 295: [Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/)

## Problem Description

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

For example, for `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.
For example, for `arr = [2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

- `MedianFinder()` initializes the MedianFinder object.
- `void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.
- `double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within 10^-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.


## Java Solution

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class MedianFinder {

    private PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap;
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap;

    public MedianFinder() {
        maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a - b);
    }

    public void addNum(int num) {
        maxHeap.offer(num);
        minHeap.offer(maxHeap.poll());

        if (maxHeap.size() < minHeap.size()) {
            maxHeap.offer(minHeap.poll());
        }
    }

    public double findMedian() {
        if (maxHeap.size() == minHeap.size()) {
            return (maxHeap.peek() + minHeap.peek()) / 2.0;
        } else {
            return maxHeap.peek();
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Adding a number: O(log N)
  - Finding Median: O(1)
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the data structure.

## Code Explanation

- We use two heaps, a max heap for the left half of the elements and a min heap for the right half of the elements.
- The max heap keeps track of the smaller half of the elements, and the min heap keeps track of the larger half.
- When adding a number, we first add it to the max heap. We then move the maximum element from the max heap to the min heap to balance the elements.
- The median is found based on the size of the two heaps. If they are equal, the median is the average of the two top elements. If the max heap is larger, the median is the top element of the max heap.
