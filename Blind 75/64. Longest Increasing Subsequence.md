# LeetCode Problem 300: [Length of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

## Problem Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

## Solution Approach

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We initialize an array `dp` of the same length as the input array, where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. We then iterate through the array and update `dp[i]` based on the maximum length of increasing subsequences ending at indices before `i`.

## Java Solution

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);

        int maxLength = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], 1 + dp[j]);
                }
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, dp[i]);
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. We have two nested loops to compute the longest increasing subsequence length for each element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We use an additional array `dp` of the same length as the input array.

## Code Explanation

- We initialize an array `dp` to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
- We fill the `dp` array with 1 initially, indicating the minimum length of increasing subsequence at each index.
- We iterate through the array and update `dp[i]` based on the maximum length of increasing subsequences ending at indices before `i`.
- We return the maximum value in the `dp` array as the result.
