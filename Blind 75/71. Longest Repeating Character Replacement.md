# LeetCode Problem 424: [Longest Repeating Character Replacement](Problem_Link)

## Problem Description

Given a string `s` that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most `k` operations on that string.

In one operation, you can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.

Find the length of the longest substring containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

## Solution Approach

We use a sliding window approach to traverse the string while maintaining a hashmap to count the occurrences of each character. We also keep track of the maximum count of a character within the current window.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int i = 0, j = 0, maxLength = 0;
        HashMap<Character, Integer> mp = new HashMap<>();

        int maxCount = 0;
        while (j < s.length()) {
            char ch = s.charAt(j);
            mp.put(ch, mp.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);

            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, mp.get(ch));
            if (j - i + 1 - maxCount > k) {
                mp.put(s.charAt(i), mp.get(s.charAt(i)) - 1);
                i++;
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, j - i + 1);
            j++;
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We traverse the string once using the sliding window approach.
- **Space Complexity**: O(26) = O(1). The hashmap can contain at most 26 characters.

## Code Explanation

- We maintain a sliding window `[i, j]` and a hashmap `mp` to count the occurrences of characters.
- We update the maximum count of a character within the current window.
- If the length of the window minus the maximum count exceeds `k`, we shrink the window from the left.
- We update the maximum length of the substring containing all repeating letters.
