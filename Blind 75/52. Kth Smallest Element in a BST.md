# LeetCode Problem 230: [Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary search tree (BST), return the kth smallest element in it.

## Solution Approach

We perform an inorder traversal of the BST and keep track of the count of visited nodes. When the count reaches k, we have found the kth smallest element.

## Java Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    int kthElement = -1;
    int count = 0;

    public int kthSmallest(TreeNode root, int k) {
        inOrder(root, k);
        return kthElement;
    }

    void inOrder(TreeNode root, int k) {
        if (root == null)
            return;

        inOrder(root.left, k);
        count++;
        if (count == k) {
            kthElement = root.val;
            return;
        }
        inOrder(root.right, k);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary search tree. In the worst case, we visit all nodes to find the kth smallest element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the binary search tree. The space complexity is determined by the function call stack during the recursive inorder traversal.

## Code Explanation

- We perform an inorder traversal of the binary search tree.
- During traversal, we keep track of the count of visited nodes.
- When the count reaches k, we have found the kth smallest element.
- We return the value of the kth smallest element.
