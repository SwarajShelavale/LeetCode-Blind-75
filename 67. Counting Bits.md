# LeetCode Problem 338: [Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

## Problem Description

Given a non-negative integer `n`, generate an array `res` of size `(n + 1)` where `res[i]` is the number of `1`'s in the binary representation of `i`.

## Solution Approach

We iterate through numbers from `0` to `n`. For each number, we count the number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation using the function `countSetBits`. We store this count in the result array.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int res[] = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            res[i] = countSetBits(i);
        }

        return res;
    }

    int countSetBits(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 31; i++) {
            count += (n & 1) == 1 ? 1 : 0;
            n = n >> 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * 32) = O(n). We iterate through each number from `0` to `n` and, for each number, perform up to 32 bit operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n). We use an additional array of size `(n + 1)` to store the counts of set bits.

## Code Explanation

- We iterate through numbers from `0` to `n`.
- For each number, we count the number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation using the function `countSetBits`.
- We store this count in the result array.
