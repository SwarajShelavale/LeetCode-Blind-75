# LeetCode Problem 261: [Graph Valid Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/)

## Problem Description

Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

## Solution Approach

To determine if a graph is a valid tree, we need to check two conditions:
1. The graph must be fully connected.
2. There should be no cycles present in the graph.

We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph and check these conditions.

## Java Solution

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean validTree(int n, int[][] edges) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.put(i, new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            graph.get(u).add(v);
            graph.get(v).add(u);
        }

        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        if (hasCycle(graph, visited, 0, -1)) {
            return false; // There is a cycle, so it's not a tree
        }

        for (boolean visit : visited) {
            if (!visit) {
                return false; // There is a disconnected node, so it's not a tree
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private boolean hasCycle(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, boolean[] visited, int node, int parent) {
        visited[node] = true;
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                if (hasCycle(graph, visited, neighbor, node)) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else if (neighbor != parent) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes (vertices) and E is the number of edges in the graph.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes (vertices) and E is the number of edges in the graph. We use a HashMap to represent the graph and boolean arrays to track visited nodes.

## Code Explanation

- We create a graph using a HashMap, where each node maps to a list of its neighbors.
- We perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of the graph to check for cycles and disconnected nodes.
- If we encounter a cycle or disconnected node during the traversal, we return false indicating that the graph is not a valid tree. Otherwise, we return true.
