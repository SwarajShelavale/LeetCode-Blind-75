# LeetCode Problem 70: [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

## Problem Description
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Solution Approach
- We use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
- We create an array `dp` to store the number of distinct ways to climb to each step.
- We initialize the base cases for `dp[0]` and `dp[1]`, as there is only 1 way to climb for these steps.
- We iterate from step 2 to `n` and calculate the number of distinct ways to reach each step using the formula: `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`.

## Java Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of steps.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the dynamic programming array `dp`.

## Code Explanation
1. We create an array `dp` to store the number of distinct ways to climb to each step.
2. We initialize the base cases for `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` to 1, as there is only one way to climb for these steps.
3. We iterate from step 2 to `n` and calculate the number of distinct ways to reach each step using the formula: `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`.
4. Finally, we return `dp[n]`, which represents the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of the staircase with `n` steps.
