# LeetCode Problem 435: [Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we can sort the intervals based on their end times. Then, we iterate through the sorted intervals and count the number of intervals that overlap with the current one. We keep track of the previous end time and update it accordingly.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
         Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));

        int count = 0, prevEnd = intervals[0][1];
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < prevEnd) {
                count++;
            } else {
                prevEnd = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting the intervals, where n is the number of intervals.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we use only a constant amount of space.

## Code Explanation

- We sort the intervals based on their end times using Arrays.sort().
- We iterate through the sorted intervals and count the number of intervals that overlap with the current one.
- We keep track of the previous end time and update it accordingly.
