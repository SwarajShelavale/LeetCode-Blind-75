# LeetCode Problem: [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

## Problem Description
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

## Solution Approach
We can merge two sorted linked lists iteratively by comparing the values of nodes and rearranging pointers.

1. **Initialization**: Initialize a dummy node `dummyHead` and a tail pointer `tail` pointing to the dummy node.
2. **Iterative Merge**: While both lists are not empty, compare the values of the current nodes `cur1` and `cur2`.
   - Attach the node with the smaller value to the `tail` and move the corresponding pointer forward.
   - Update the `tail` pointer to the newly attached node.
3. **Connect Remaining Nodes**: After one of the lists becomes empty, connect the remaining nodes of the non-empty list to the `tail`.
4. **Return Merged List**: Return `dummyHead.next` as the merged list.

## Java Solution Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        if(l1 == null)
            return l2;
        else if(l2 == null)
            return l1;
        
        ListNode dummyHead = new ListNode(-1);
        ListNode tail = dummyHead;
        ListNode cur1 = l1;
        ListNode cur2 = l2;

        while(cur1 != null && cur2 != null) {
            if(cur1.val < cur2.val) {
                tail.next = cur1;
                cur1 = cur1.next;
            } else {
                tail.next = cur2;
                cur2 = cur2.next;
            }
            tail = tail.next;
        }

        if(cur1 == null)
            tail.next = cur2;
        else
            tail.next = cur1;

        return dummyHead.next;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the two input lists.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), constant extra space is used.

## Code Explanation
- We iterate through the lists, comparing the values of nodes, and rearranging pointers to merge the lists in sorted order.
