# LeetCode Problem 139: [Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/)

## Problem Description

Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return true if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

## Solution Approach

We use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We iterate through the string `s` and check if substrings from the start of the string can be segmented into words from the dictionary. We use memoization to avoid recomputation of results for overlapping subproblems.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {
        HashSet<String> dictionary = new HashSet<>(wordDict);
        return findWord(0, s, dictionary, new Boolean[s.length()]);
    }

    boolean findWord(int start, String s, HashSet<String> dictionary, Boolean[] memo) {
        if (start == s.length()) {
            return true;
        }

        if (memo[start] != null) {
            return memo[start];
        }

        for (int end = start + 1; end <= s.length(); end++) {
            if (dictionary.contains(s.substring(start, end)) && findWord(end, s, dictionary, memo)) {
                return memo[start] = true;
            }
        }

        return memo[start] = false;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. We use nested loops to iterate through the string and its substrings.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the memoization array.

## Code Explanation

1. We define a function `wordBreak` that checks if the string `s` can be segmented into words from the dictionary.
2. We initialize a HashSet `dictionary` with words from the `wordDict` list for efficient lookup.
3. We call the `findWord` function to recursively check if substrings of `s` starting from different indices can be segmented into words from the dictionary.
4. In the `findWord` function, we use memoization to avoid recomputation of results for overlapping subproblems.
5. We iterate through substrings of `s` starting from the `start` index and check if the substring exists in the dictionary. If it does, we recursively check the remaining substring.
6. If the substring can be segmented into words from the dictionary, we return true; otherwise, we return false.
