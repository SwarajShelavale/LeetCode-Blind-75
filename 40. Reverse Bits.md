# LeetCode Problem 190: [Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

## Problem Description

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

## Solution Approach

We iterate through each bit of the given integer and reverse its position.

## Java Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((n & (1 << i)) != 0)
                ans = ans << 1 | 1;
            else
                ans = ans << 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1). We iterate through 32 bits of the integer, which is constant.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). Constant space is used.

## Code Explanation

- We initialize an integer `ans` to store the reversed bits.
- We iterate through each bit of the given integer `n`.
- If the bit is set (1), we set the corresponding bit in the answer `ans`.
- Otherwise, we shift the answer `ans` to the left.
- Finally, we return the reversed integer `ans`.
