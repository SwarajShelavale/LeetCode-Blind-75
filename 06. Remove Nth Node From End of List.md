# LeetCode Problem 19: [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

## Problem Description
Given the head of a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of the list and return its head.

## Solution Approach
- We use a two-pointer approach to find the Nth node from the end of the list.
- We initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the list.
- We move the `fast` pointer n steps ahead.
- Then, we move both pointers simultaneously until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list.
- At this point, the `slow` pointer is at the Nth node from the end.
- We skip the Nth node by adjusting the pointers.

## Java Solution Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null)
            return null;
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;

        // Move the fast pointer n steps ahead
        while (n != 0) {
            fast = fast.next;
            n--;
        }
        
        // If fast becomes null, the head needs to be removed
        if (fast == null)
            return head.next;
        
        // Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        
        // Remove the Nth node by skipping it
        slow.next = slow.next.next;
        
        return head;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space for pointers.

## Code Explanation
- We initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the list.
- We move the `fast` pointer n steps ahead.
- Then, we move both pointers simultaneously until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list.
- At this point, the `slow` pointer is at the Nth node from the end.
- We skip the Nth node by adjusting the pointers.
