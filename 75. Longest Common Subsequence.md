# LeetCode Problem 1143:  [Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

## Problem Description

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. 

## Solution Approach

To find the longest common subsequence between two strings `text1` and `text2`, we can use dynamic programming. We create a 2D array `dp[][]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of substrings `text1.substring(0, i)` and `text2.substring(0, j)`. We iterate through the strings `text1` and `text2` and fill the `dp[][]` array accordingly.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int n = text1.length();
        int m = text2.length();
        
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][m + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
                if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][m];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n*m), where n is the length of `text1` and m is the length of `text2`. We traverse through each character of both strings once to fill the 2D array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n*m), the space used by the 2D array `dp[][]` to store the length of the longest common subsequence for each substring of `text1` and `text2`.

## Code Explanation

- We create a 2D array `dp[][]` to store the length of the longest common subsequence for each prefix of `text1` and `text2`.
- We iterate through both strings and fill the `dp[][]` array based on the characters being equal or not.
- Finally, we return `dp[n][m]`, where n is the length of `text1` and m is the length of `text2`, representing the length of the longest common subsequence between the two strings.
