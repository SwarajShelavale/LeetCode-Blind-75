# LeetCode Problem 102: [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

## Problem Description
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

## Solution Approach
- We perform a level order traversal using a queue data structure.
- We iterate through each level of the tree, adding the values of nodes at each level to the result list.

## Java Solution Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> levelOrder(TreeNode root) {
        List<List<Integer>> levelOrder = new ArrayList<>();

        if (root == null)
            return levelOrder;

        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            List<Integer> level = new ArrayList<>();
            int size = queue.size();

            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode current = queue.poll();
                level.add(current.val);

                if (current.left != null)
                    queue.offer(current.left);

                if (current.right != null)
                    queue.offer(current.right);
            }
            levelOrder.add(level);
        }
        return levelOrder;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for the queue data structure, which can hold up to N/2 nodes in the worst case, where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

## Code Explanation
1. We create a result list `levelOrder` to store the level order traversal of the binary tree.
2. We use a queue to perform level order traversal. We start by adding the root node to the queue.
3. We iterate through each level of the tree using a while loop until the queue is empty.
4. At each level, we create a list `level` to store the values of nodes at that level.
5. We iterate through the nodes at the current level, adding their values to the `level` list.
6. While traversing each node, if the node has left and right children, we add them to the queue for the next level traversal.
7. Once we finish traversing the current level, we add the `level` list to the `levelOrder` result list.
8. Finally, we return the `levelOrder` list containing the level order traversal of the binary tree.
