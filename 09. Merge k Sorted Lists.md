# LeetCode Problem 23: [Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)

## Problem Description
Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity without examples and constraints.

## Solution Approach
- We can merge k sorted linked lists by iteratively merging two lists at a time.
- We merge the lists pairwise until we have merged all lists into one.

## Java Solution Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {
        int n = lists.length;
        ListNode newHead = null;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            newHead = mergeTwoLists(newHead, lists[i]);
        
        return newHead;
    }

    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        if (l1 == null)
            return l2;
        else if (l2 == null)
            return l1;
        
        ListNode head = null, tail = null, cur1 = l1, cur2 = l2;
        if (cur1.val < cur2.val) {
            head = cur1;
            tail = cur1;
            cur1 = cur1.next;
        } else {
            head = cur2;
            tail = cur2;
            cur2 = cur2.next;
        }

        while (cur1 != null && cur2 != null) {
            if (cur1.val < cur2.val) {
                tail.next = cur1;
                tail = tail.next;
                cur1 = cur1.next;
            } else {
                tail.next = cur2;
                tail = tail.next;
                cur2 = cur2.next;
            }
        }

        if (cur1 == null)
            tail.next = cur2;
        else
            tail.next = cur1;

        return head;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log k), where N is the total number of elements in all lists and k is the number of lists.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), constant extra space is used.

## Code Explanation
- We iterate through the lists, comparing the values of nodes, and rearranging pointers to merge the lists in sorted order.
