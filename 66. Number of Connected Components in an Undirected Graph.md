# LeetCode Problem 323: [Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/)

## Problem Description

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

## Solution Approach

We can solve this problem using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. We traverse through the graph starting from each unvisited node and mark all connected nodes as visited. The number of times we perform this operation gives us the count of connected components in the graph.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int countComponents(int n, int[][] edges) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        List<List<Integer>> adjacencyList = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            adjacencyList.add(new ArrayList<>());

        // Building adjacency list
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            adjacencyList.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            adjacencyList.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(i, adjacencyList, visited);
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    private void dfs(int node, List<List<Integer>> adjacencyList, boolean[] visited) {
        visited[node] = true;
        for (int neighbor : adjacencyList.get(node)) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                dfs(neighbor, adjacencyList, visited);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph. We traverse each node and edge once during DFS.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph. We use additional space for the adjacency list and the visited array.

## Code Explanation

- We initialize a boolean array `visited` to keep track of visited nodes.
- We create an adjacency list to represent the graph.
- We traverse through the graph using DFS starting from each unvisited node.
- During DFS traversal, we mark all connected nodes as visited.
- Each DFS traversal corresponds to a connected component, and we increment the count accordingly.
- Finally, we return the count of connected components in the graph.
