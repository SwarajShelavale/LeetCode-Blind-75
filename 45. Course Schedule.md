# LeetCode Problem 207: [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

## Problem Description

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Solution Approach

We can solve this problem using depth-first search (DFS) with a topological sort approach. We create an adjacency list representing the course prerequisites. Then, we perform DFS traversal on each course to check for cycles in the graph. If a cycle is found, it means the courses cannot be completed, and we return `false`. Otherwise, we return `true`.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++)
            adj.add(new ArrayList<>());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < prerequisites.length; i++)
            adj.get(prerequisites[i][0]).add(prerequisites[i][1]);
        
        int[] topo = new int[numCourses];
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[numCourses];

        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                if (dfs(i, adj, visited, topo))
                    return false;
            }
        } 

        return true;
    }

    boolean dfs(int node, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, boolean[] visited, int[] topo) {
        visited[node] = true;
        topo[node] = 1;

        for (int x : adj.get(node)) {
            if (!visited[x]) {
                if (dfs(x, adj, visited, topo))
                    return true;
            } else if (topo[x] == 1)
                return true;
        }

        topo[node] = 0;
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of courses (vertices) and E is the number of dependencies (edges) in the graph. We visit each course and its dependencies once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of courses and E is the number of dependencies. We use space for the adjacency list, visited array, and topo array.

## Code Explanation

1. We initialize an adjacency list to represent the prerequisites of each course.
2. We perform DFS traversal on each course to check for cycles in the graph.
3. If a cycle is found during the DFS traversal, we return `false` indicating that the courses cannot be completed.
4. Otherwise, we return `true` indicating that all courses can be finished.
