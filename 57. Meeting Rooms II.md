# LeetCode Problem 253: [Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of meeting time intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of conference rooms required.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the ending times of ongoing meetings. We sort the intervals based on their start times and iterate through them. If the start time of the current interval is greater than or equal to the end time of the meeting with the earliest end time in the priority queue, we update that meeting with the current interval's end time. Otherwise, we add the current interval's end time to the priority queue, indicating the need for a new meeting room.

## Java Solution

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int minMeetingRooms(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        pq.offer(intervals[0][1]);
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] >= pq.peek()) {
                pq.poll();
            }
            pq.offer(intervals[i][1]);
        }
        return pq.size();
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N), where N is the number of intervals. We sort the intervals based on their start times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of intervals. We use a priority queue to keep track of the ending times of ongoing meetings.

## Code Explanation

- We sort the intervals based on their start times using a custom comparator.
- We use a priority queue to keep track of the ending times of ongoing meetings.
- We iterate through the sorted intervals and update the priority queue accordingly to determine the minimum number of conference rooms required.
