# LeetCode Problem 1: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

# Problem Description
   Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
  
## Solution Approach
- Create a HashMap to store elements and their indices.
- Iterate through the array.
- Check if `target - nums[i]` exists in the HashMap.
- If found, return the indices.
- If not found, add the current element along with its index to the HashMap.

## Java Solution Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int ans[] = new int[2];

        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++)
        {
            if(map.containsKey(target-nums[i]))
            {
                ans[0]=i;
                ans[1]=map.get(target-nums[i]);
                break;
            }
            map.put(nums[i],i);
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
# Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

# Code Explanation
- Utilizes a HashMap to efficiently find the complement of each element.
- Iterates through the array once, finding the complement for each element.
