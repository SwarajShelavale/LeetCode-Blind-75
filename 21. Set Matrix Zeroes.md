# LeetCode Problem 73: [Set Matrix Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)

## Problem Description
Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place.

## Solution Approach
- We iterate through the matrix and mark the first element of each row and column as 0 if the corresponding element in the matrix is 0.
- Then, we iterate through the matrix again and set the elements to 0 based on the marked rows and columns.
- Finally, we handle the special case for the first row and first column.

## Java Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public void setZeroes(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        int m = matrix[0].length;
        int col0 = 1;

        // Mark all elements
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {
                    // Set 0th row
                    matrix[i][0] = 0;
                    // Set 0th column
                    if (j == 0)
                        col0 = 0;
                    else
                        matrix[0][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }

        // Update matrix based on marked rows and columns
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][0] == 0 || matrix[0][j] == 0)
                    matrix[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }

        // Update first row
        if (matrix[0][0] == 0) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++)
                matrix[0][j] = 0;
        }

        // Update first column
        if (col0 == 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                matrix[i][0] = 0;
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), constant extra space is used.

## Code Explanation
1. We iterate through the matrix to mark the first element of each row and column as 0 if the corresponding element in the matrix is 0.
2. During this marking process, we also maintain a flag `col0` to determine if the first column needs to be zeroed out.
3. After marking, we iterate through the matrix again and set the elements to 0 based on the marked rows and columns.
4. Finally, we handle the special cases for the first row and first column by updating them accordingly.
