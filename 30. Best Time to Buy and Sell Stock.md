# LeetCode Problem [121]: [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

## Problem Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## Solution Approach
- We iterate through the prices array and keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve by buying on a given day and selling on a future day.
- We update the maximum profit whenever we find a day where selling the stock at the current price would result in a higher profit than the previously calculated profit.

## Java Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0, i = 0, j = 1;
        while (j < prices.length) {
            if (prices[i] < prices[j])
                profit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[j] - prices[i]);
            else
                i = j;
            j++;
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the prices array. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), constant extra space is used.

## Code Explanation
1. We initialize the profit variable to 0, which represents the maximum profit we can achieve.
2. We use two pointers, i and j, to traverse the prices array. We start with i at 0 and j at 1.
3. We iterate through the prices array and check if the current price (prices[j]) is greater than the price on the day we bought the stock (prices[i]).
4. If the current price is greater, we calculate the profit we can achieve by selling the stock on the current day (prices[j] - prices[i]) and update the maximum profit if needed.
5. If the current price is not greater, we update the buy day to the current day (i = j) and continue.
6. We continue this process until we reach the end of the prices array.
7. Finally, we return the maximum profit calculated during the traversal.
