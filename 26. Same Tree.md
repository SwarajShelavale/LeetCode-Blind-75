# LeetCode Problem 100: [Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

## Problem Description
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, determine if they are the same.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

## Solution Approach
- We use a recursive approach to traverse both trees simultaneously.
- At each node, we compare their values and recursively check their left and right subtrees.

## Java Solution Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (p == null && q == null)
            return true;
        if (p == null || q == null)
            return false;

        return p.val == q.val && isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary trees p and q. We visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for the recursive call stack, where N is the height of the binary trees in the worst case.

## Code Explanation
1. We use a recursive helper function `isSameTree` to compare the nodes of both trees.
2. If both trees are empty (null), they are considered the same.
3. If one tree is empty and the other is not, they are not the same.
4. Otherwise, we compare the values of the current nodes and recursively check their left and right subtrees.
5. If the values match and both subtrees are the same, we return `true`, indicating that the trees are the same.
6. We repeat this process for each node in both trees, starting from the root.
