# LeetCode Problem 133: [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

## Problem Description

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

## Solution Approach

To clone the graph, we perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the original graph. We use a HashMap to keep track of visited nodes and their corresponding cloned nodes. At each step of the DFS traversal, we create a new node and add it to the HashMap. We then recursively traverse the neighbors of the current node and add them to the neighbor list of the cloned node. Finally, we return the cloned graph.

## Java Solution

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
    public Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    public Node(int _val, ArrayList<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        HashMap<Node, Node> visited = new HashMap<>();
        return cloneGraphDFSHelper(node, visited);
    }

    private Node cloneGraphDFSHelper(Node cur, HashMap<Node, Node> visited) {
        if (cur == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (visited.containsKey(cur)) {
            return visited.get(cur);
        }

        Node newNode = new Node(cur.val);
        visited.put(cur, newNode);

        for (Node n : cur.neighbors) {
            newNode.neighbors.add(cloneGraphDFSHelper(n, visited));
        }

        return newNode;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of nodes (vertices) and \(E\) is the number of edges in the graph.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V)\) for the HashMap to store visited nodes.

## Code Explanation

1. We define a function `cloneGraph` that clones the given graph.
2. We initialize an empty HashMap `visited` to keep track of visited nodes and their clones.
3. We call the DFS helper function `cloneGraphDFSHelper` with the starting node and the `visited` HashMap.
4. In the DFS helper function, if the current node is null, we return null.
5. If the current node is already visited, we return its clone from the `visited` HashMap.
6. Otherwise, we create a new node with the current node's value and add it to the `visited` HashMap.
7. We then iterate through the neighbors of the current node and recursively clone each neighbor, adding it to the cloned node's neighbors list.
8. Finally, we return the cloned graph.
